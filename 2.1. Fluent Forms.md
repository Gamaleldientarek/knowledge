### Hide form after submission

* To **hide a form after submission**, you must enable the `Settings & Integrations > Conditional Confirmations > Add Confirmation > Make its Type = Same Page`.
* A Hide form after submission button will appear under the Message editor.
* Please note that this option will override your Settings > Confirmation Settings. So if you want to open a custom url, you won't be able to do that if you choose to hide the form after submission. This is currently a Fluentform issue that has no quick solution.
* If you want to open a link after submission and hide the form at the same time, consider embedding the link in the success message. 
	* If your link is a downloadable file, consider using the [Download Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-manager/) plugin and use the shortcode in the success message body.

### Download file after submission

If you want to let the user download a file after submission, you have the following scenarios:

1. S**imple download link**: embedded in the success message
2. **Start download automatically (Form still shows on the page)**: From the `Settings > Conditional Settings` and choose `Custom Link` and insert your link to the file.
3. **Start download automatically and hide form**: Consider [[#Hide form after submission]].

### Email Notifications

* You can send notification to yourself, your team, or the sender of the form.
* Make sure when you start you have only one notification and test it properly, only add necessary notifications.
